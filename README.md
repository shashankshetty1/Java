**Java Learning Repository**

This repository contains my Java practice files where I have been learning and implementing various concepts, including:
 **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
 **Arrays**
 **Strings**
 **HashMaps**

I am continuously working on this repository, adding new programs, improving existing code, and exploring more Java concepts.
This serves as both my learning record and a place to track my progress in Java.
